## Executive Summary

<blockquote>The website provided very positive results to functional tests performed by users with disabilities. Out of five use cases across three assistive technologies, no users found accessibility issues large enough to fail a single use case . The use cases covered the core areas of the site, asking users to register for an account, sign up for a class, search through the help center, modify their accountâ€™s settings, and update to a verified certificate course. </blockquote>

---

## Executive Summary

<blockquote>
Manual testing corroborated the functional testing results; violations were noted, but none would actively prevent a user from accessing content. The most commonly noted challenges included custom controls that did not contain valid role and state information, contrast violations, and form fields either using only placeholders as labels or not having any programmatically determinable labels.

# Preventing new issues

.subtitle[It takes a village]

.thirdtitle[The ask]

---

## How do we prevent new accessibility issues?

We need a culture change

* *Do I have to make this accessible, too?*
  * *Is this covered under the agreement?*
  * *This is going to be hard/take a lot of work to make accessible. Do we still have to do it?*
  * *How many users does this really affect?*

---

## How do we prevent new accessibility issues?
  
We need to demonstrate our commitment from the top down.

* Hire accessiblity aware employees
* Something we *want* to do, not something we *have* to do
* Begin with accessiblity (planning) not end with it (acceptance)
* Make accessibilty a first class citizen
* No compromises
