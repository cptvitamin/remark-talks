## *What* is accessibility?

.subtitle[What do we mean when we talk about  

"accessibility"  
"disability"  
"assistive technology"]  

.thirdtitle[]

---

### What is accessibility?

<blockquote>The degree to which a product, service or environment is available to a person</blockquote>

* A *relative* term
* Can be *direct*
* Can be *indirect* (Assistive Technology or AT)
* Is synonymous with *quality*
* Often achieved by giving users *choice*
* *A high quality product is accessible to **as many people as possible***

---

### What is disability?

<blockquote>Some type of an impairment (relative) that can be physical, cognitive, mental, sensory, emotional, developmental, or some combination of these. </blockquote>

* Present at birth, or occur during lifetime
* Can even be temporary
* Also a relative term (differently able)

---

### What is assistive technology?

<blockquote>Devices or software that people can use to help them access or use a product, device or environment. AT enables people to perform tasks that they may be unable to accomplish, or have difficulty with.</blockquote>

* Enhances or changes how a person interacts with products, devices, or environments

## *Why* should we worry about accessibility?

.subtitle[]  

.thirdtitle[]

---

### The Web - The Great Equalizer

<blockquote>"The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of ability is an essential aspect."</blockquote>

  - Tim Berners-Lee  
  W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

---

### The Web is for everyone

The word everyone is by definition "inclusive." It includes all humans, regardless of race, gender, class, creed, age, nationality, physical location, sexual orientation, or ability.  

---

### The Americans with Disabilities Act

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits discrimination based on disability, much like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and national origin.

The ADA imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations. The ADA was passed into law before the World Wide Web became a commonly available public resource and so it did not define what an "accessible" website would be.  Recent rulings have determined that the web can be considered a public accommodation.

An inaccessible web might be considered an act of discrimination.

## Accessibility Concepts

.subtitle[Getting Started]  

.thirdtitle[How people use digital products and how to best reach them]

---

### Accessibility is relative

* Too easy to assume that if its accessible to you, its accessible to everyone.
* Tend to design for the typical user.
* Product is only accessible to people who use the product just like you do.

Solution: Understand the various ways in which people *can* and *do* interact with digital products.
---

### Typical user

* Clicks icons with a mouse (Input);
* Touches icons with their fingers (Input);
* Types text with a physical, standard, keyboard (Input);
* Scrolls pages up and down with a mouse wheel or trackpad (Input);
* Reads text with their eyes (Output); and
* Listens to audio content with their ears (Output).

Now, let's spend some time talking about other ways people interact with digital products.

---

### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

Creating digital products that are accessible to people with disabilities requires a technical understanding of how they use technology (a.k.a. assistive or access technology) and empathy, so that we can more deeply understand the everyday challenges people with disabilities face and how assistive technology can be used to overcome them.

Helps to think of Human-Computer Interaction as simply:

* Input
* Output

---
### A brief history of...

.float-right.scale50[![Screenshot of terminal as seen in Movie Wargames.](assets/falken.jpg)]

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

Back in the olden days:

* Input
  * Text
* Output
  * Text

---
### HCI is not complicated

.float-right.scale50[![Screenshot of windows 3.1.](assets/win31.png)]

Introduced some accessibility challenges:

* Input
  * Support for pointing devices
* Output
  * Support for images, video, audio, PDF, spreadsheets, simulations

---
### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

.float-right.scale50[![Image of Tom Cruise controlling computer with gestures in Minority Report.](assets/tomcruise.jpg)]

Solutions:

* Input
  * Always support the keyboard
* Output
  * Always make available as text

---
### Keyboard support (Input)

* It's how it was done from the beginning
* If it works with a keyboard, it works for things that emulate a keyboard
  * Joysticks
  * Sip-and-puff
  * Speech input
  * On-screen keyboards
  * Gesture-based input devices

---
### Text all the things (Output)

Text can:

* be transformed into sound,
* be transformed into touch,
* be translated into other languages,
* become smaller or larger,
* change color,
* be assigned meta (magical) properties through the power of markup,
* be read by machines!

*Understanding these basic challenges and solutions will make more advanced accessibility concepts easier to understand.*

---

### Not just a technical solution

How to implement Accessibility at your organization

* Policy
* Support
* Documentation
* Training
* Reporting
* Independent Audit
* Remediation
* Ongoing Conformance

---

### How do we measure conformance?

* Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
* User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 1.0 (User Agents are "any software that retrieves and presents Web content for users." e.g Web browsers, screen readers, and media players.
* Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 (Drupal, Wordpress, and edX Studio are considered to be Authoring Tools.)
* WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) (Modern web applications with custom controls and lots of interactivity)
* WCAG2ICT (Apply the concepts of WCAG to other Information and Communication Technology)
* EPUB 3.0 (An accessible ebook standard)
* DAISY (Standard for making ebooks more accessible)
* MathML (A markup language for expressing mathematical notation)

---

## WCAG 2.0 AA

.subtitle[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0]

.thirdtitle[How to measure conformance]

---
### WCAG 2.0

Technical set of guidelines published by the W3C in 2008

* 4 Principles
* 12 Guidelines
* 65 Success Criteria - Testable Statements
  * (38 applicable to Level AA)
* Hundreds of Techniques and supporting documents

---

### WCAG 2.0 Core Principles

* **Perceivable:**<br>Content must be presented in a way that all users can perceive it
* **Operable:**<br>Components and navigation must be operable
* **Understandable:**<br>Information and navigation must be understandable
* **Robust:**<br>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents including assistive technology

---

### Principle 1: Perceivable

* 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
* 1.2 Time-based Media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.
* 1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
* 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

---

### Principle 2: Operable

* 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
* 2.2 Enough Time: Provide users enough time to read and use content.
* 2.3 Seizures: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
* 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

---

### Principle 3: Understandable

* 3.1 Readable: Make text content readable and understandable.
* 3.2 Predictable: Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
* 3.3 Input Assistance: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

---

### Principle 4: Robust

* 4.1 Compatible: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Web Content Accessibility

.subtitle[*In plain English*]

---

### What is *content*?

* .highlight[Text]
* .highlight[Images]
* .highlight[Video]
* Lists (of text)
* Tables (of text)
* PDFs (of text and images)
* eBooks (of text and images)

---
class: shift-down

## Text

* is accessible
* is translatable
* .highlight[can be read by *software*] (like Assistive Technology)
* can be converted into other formats

---
class: title middle right shift-up

### We NEED to TEXT all the things

---
class: title middle right shift-up

### Problem: All text is created equal

.subtitle[Solution: Markup to the rescue!]

.thirdtitle[*By itself, text has no semantic value*]

---

### Why is markup so important?

.highlight[*Software is really good at reading markup*]

* Assistive Technology (AT) relies on markup to determine the "role" the text plays
* AT provides [shortcuts](http://doccenter.freedomscientific.com/doccenter/archives/training/jawskeystrokes.htm) to interact with markup
* AT users benefit *greatly* from these shortcuts
* Without proper markup, its just giant blobs of text

---

### Semantic Markup

What "role" does the text play?

* Is it a .highlight[heading]?
* Is it a list, or an item in a .highlight[list]?
* Is it a .highlight[link]?
* An .highlight[iframe]?
* Just a .highlight[paragraph]?

*AT provides direct and enhanced access to all of these (and more). This functionality is not possible without the right markup.*

---

### Headings

* All AT provides multiple ways for users to browse by heading (examples):
  * Next heading (at any level)
  * Next level 3 heading
  * First heading
  * First level 2 heading

.highlight[Logical order is important]

*This won't work if your text just looks like a heading*

### This is a level 3 heading

.fake-heading[This is not a level 3 heading]  

---
layout: true

### Links

---

.float-right.scale50[![Screenshot of links list in Voiceover](assets/mIsec.png)]

* All AT provides multiple ways of navigating between links on a page:
  * By tabbing (of course)
  * In an .highlight[interactive list]
   * Where links can be directly accessed by .highlight[how they are spelled] or their .highlight[order in the document]

---

Bad:

* [Click here](#) to register
* Article teaser [More...](#)
* [Download](#) the white paper

Good:

* [Register for the conference](#)
* [What is accessible content: Full Text](#)
* [Download the PDF white paper](#)

---
layout: false

### Color contrast

* Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1
* Large text can have a ratio of 3 to 1
    * 18pt and 14pt bold<br>(roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% )

  <p style="font-size: 18pt">This is 18pt text</p>
  <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">This is 14pt bold</p>

*Contrast ratios or nearly impossible to analyze without the help of [color contrast analyzing tools/software](#tools)*

## Images

.subtitle[We need to text all the images, too!]

.thirdtitle[The ALT Attribute]

---
### Text alternatives (using the alt attribute)

* Can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user.
* Authoring useful alt attribute content requires the author to carefully consider the .highlight[context] in which the image appears and the .highlight[function] that image may have in that context.
* Needs to be an appropriate .highlight[functional replacement] for the image.

---

### How do I determine what is *appropriate* alt content?

*A good place to start is by asking the following questions:*

* Why is the image being included in a page?
* What is its purpose?
* Does it provide useful information?
* Does it perform a function?
* Is it a label for an interactive element?
* Is it purely decorative?

*Answers to these questions can help you use a simple decision tree:*

---

### Is this image the only content of a link or form control?

**Yes:**

.float-right.center[![Screenshot of Introduction to Linux course card with an arrow highlighting the image linked to the course intro video](assets/EFAou.png)<br>![Screenshot of various social icons](assets/7xE4S.png)]

Use the alt attribute communicate the destination of the link or action taken

*A good alt value for this image would be "Watch the 'Introduction to Linux' course video", which describes the action, not the image.*

**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:**

.float-right.scale40[![Screenshot of stylized text that represents the 3 main topics on the page, verbatim](assets/T2axY.png)]

* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, .highlight[use an empty alt attribute] to hide the image from screen reader users.

* If the text included is just for visual effect, use an empty alt attribute.

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to include the communicative text of the image.

**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:**

.float-right.scale40[![Screenshot of computer code transparently overlaying a computer keyboard](assets/LFS01_Ch0_Screen7.jpg)]

* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, use an empty alt attribute to hide the image from screen reader users.

* If the text included is just for visual effect, .highlight[use an empty alt attribute].

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to include the communicative text of the image.

**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does this image contain text?

**Yes:**

<figure class="float-right scale40">
  <img src="assets/fGqVI.png" alt="Screenshot of stylized text illustrating 3 points">
  <figcaption>Appropriate alt for this image would be: "1: Things change in linux. 2: We've repeated some things in the class. 3: We've tried to avoid holy wars."</figcaption>
</figure>

* If the text in the image is also present as real text nearby, use an empty alt attribute to hide the image from screen reader users.

* If the text included is just for visual effect, use an empty alt attribute.

* Otherwise, use the alt attribute to .highlight[include the communicative text of the image].

**No:** Next slide!

---

### Does the image contribute meaning to the current page or context?

* **Yes**, and it’s a simple graphic or photograph: .highlight[the alt attribute should briefly describe the image in a way that conveys that meaning].
* **Yes**, and it’s a graph or complex piece of information: .highlight[include the information contained in the image elsewhere on the page].
* **Yes**, but a suitable alt text is unknown at the time of publication (for example on a photo upload site): .highlight[provide an alt attribute or caption for the image that includes as much useful information as possible].

**No:**

Next slide!

---

### Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?

* Use an .highlight[empty alt attribute].  This will make it invisible to a screen reader user.

## Video

* All sound needs to have a textual equivalent
  * Captions
  * Transcript

* All on screen text needs to have an audible equivalent
  * And non-text content that is important to the context of the video must also have an audible equivalent<br>
